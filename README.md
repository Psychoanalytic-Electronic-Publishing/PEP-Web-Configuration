# PEP-Web-Configuration
Issues/Task Database/Repository for PEP-Web Setup

The purpose of this repository is to use the GIT Issues facility to set up tasks and issues communication for the various Administrative Setup tasks for PEP-Web.

It's also possible we will use the repository to store versions of configurations, but these are in the RDS database, not files, so it's not the immediate goal.
